# The Collection

A personal film curation tool for reflective movie watching. Not a streaming app or social network — a private archive for deepening understanding of your own taste through deliberate selection, real-time companionship while watching, and AI-assisted reflection.

---

## What it does

- **Curate** your collection across five categories: Collection, To Watch, Wildcard, Meh, Don't Recommend
- **Anticipated** — track unreleased films with a countdown to their theatrical premiere; notifies you when something you were waiting for has arrived
- **Reference films** — pin up to 12 standards that anchor your taste and inform recommendations
- **AI recommendations** powered by Claude, tuned to your taste profile
- **Now Watching widget** — track a live session with a real-time timer, pause/resume, and a film companion (timed facts + chat)
- **Companion** — spoiler-aware film notes and freeform chat during a watch session
- **Persona** — AI-generated taste portrait that evolves with your collection
- **Snapshots** — point-in-time backups of your full collection state

## Stack

- Vercel serverless functions for API routes
- Supabase for auth and cloud sync
- Claude (Anthropic) for recommendations, companion, and persona
