# The Collection — Release Notes

---

## Latest — 2026-03-31

### Modal — Loading Skeleton
- Skeleton now precisely matches the real modal layout: correct heights for rating badges, watch button, tagline, overview lines, cast photos, and section labels
- Cast character names now show two stacked bars to account for wrapping (e.g. long character names no longer cause a height jump on load)
- Crew skeleton increased to 5 items to match the P75 of real film data — prevents a full extra row appearing after load
- Fixed structural mismatch where skeleton was flat while real component has a sticky header + scrollable content wrapper — eliminated a 12px shift on every modal open

### Modal — Tab Switching
- Fixed Session tab height: the height of the Details tab is now locked in before switching, so the Session tab always matches it — previously only worked after switching back and forth once
- Added keyboard shortcut `[` / `]` to switch between Details and Session tabs without reaching for the mouse
- Pressing `]` on the last tab wraps around to the first (and vice versa for `[`)

### Component Sandbox
- Extracted `CardComponent`, `ModalComponent`, `NWWComponent` as standalone IIFE modules in `components/`
- Added `sandbox/` — isolated component gallery with interactive controls and all permutations per component
- Sandbox accessible at `/sandbox/` in dev; blocked from production via `vercel.json`

### Performance
- Render from localStorage immediately on init — grid visible before auth or cloud sync completes
- Supabase SDK and SortableJS removed from critical path — loaded dynamically after first paint
- Added `defer` to all script tags for parallel downloads
- Fold textures persisted to localStorage — generated once per movie, loaded instantly on every subsequent reload

### UI Polish
- Golden travelling border on cards with an active watch session (`@property` conic-gradient animation)
- Session-in-progress indicator moved to title level in movie modal
- Tilt/hover effect applied consistently across all grid views (Watchlist, Wildcard, Meh, Banned)
- Director backfill for manually-added movies — resolved on next modal open
- Live card border upgraded: comet-shaped rotating gradient with layered bloom glow — fixed a long-standing CSS specificity bug that was silently suppressing the gradient
- Sandbox poster images cached in localStorage — loads instantly after first visit instead of fetching on every open
- Sandbox chrome updated to light theme to match the main app

### Bug Fixes
- Snapshots now work correctly after Supabase migration — local dev falls back to filesystem, production uses the database with proper auth

### Now Watching Widget
- Replaced the full-screen "Screening Tonight" overlay with a **floating bottom-right widget**
- Three visual states: idle button, collapsed pill with live timer, expanded panel with full controls
- **Real-time timer** with pause/resume, progress bar scrub, and clickable time editing (h:mm:ss)
- **Search with quick-picks**: start a session from the widget itself — shows 5 most recent watchlist items plus full search
- **Decision flow**: Collection / Meh / Don't Recommend buttons after watching, with 2-second auto-collapse confirmation
- **localStorage persistence**: survives page refresh, restores timer position and pause state
- **Mobile responsive**: full-width at <600px
- z-index 8000 (above movie modal, below search modal)

### Curator v2
- Taste profile restructured into two levels: **insights** (400–600 word extended analysis) and **prompt_section** (150–200 word lean injection)
- `prompt_section` uses **SEEK / AVOID / WEIGHT** bullet structure — patterns only, no redundant film names
- Curator agent now supports **incremental mode** (default: diffs against baseline snapshot) and **fresh mode** (full rebuild)
- `recommend.js` reads profile per-request instead of caching at module init — updates take effect immediately without redeploy

### Enricher Improvements
- Enricher now backfills **missing directors** alongside IMDb/RT ratings
- **Optimized API calls**: skips TMDB when `imdb_id` already exists, goes straight to OMDB
- "Add film" search now **auto-fetches director** from movie details API after adding

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed snapshot restore missing **meh**, **standards**, and **totalCost** fields
- Fixed auth middleware returning 401 when Supabase not configured (stub user fallback)
- Fixed incorrect IMDB IDs for Burning (Lee Chang-dong) and A Separation (Asghar Farhadi)

### Ideas & Planning
- Created Ideas.md for tracking future development ideas
- PRD: Taste Match — multi-user profile comparison (Issue #2)
- PRD: Quick-Pick Profile Creation for new users (Issue #3)
- PRD: Now Watching Companion — timed facts, conversation, signal extraction (Issue #4)

### Multi-User Prep (Supabase)
- Added Supabase Auth (magic link / passwordless email)

- All API endpoints gated with auth (graceful skip when unconfigured)
- Login page, auth.js client, storage.js sync layer, supabase-schema.sql
